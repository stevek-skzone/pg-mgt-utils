# Installation

## Stable release

To install pg-mgt-utils, run this command in your
terminal:

``` console
$ pip install pg-mgt-utils
```

This is the preferred method to install pg-mgt-utils, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.
